# PointerDemo
This is a sample UWP project that explores the use of `SwapChainPanel` and `CoreIndependentInputSource` to create a visualization that's rendered on a separate thread from the XAML framework, but integrates with the project's XAML UI.

Most of the interesting code lives inside the `PointerRenderer` class.
